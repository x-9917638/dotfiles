This repo contains my dotfiles for various systems.

It currently contains 2 branches:
- old: My old dotfiles. Almost none of the configuration is in use. The organisation in this branch is very bad, and I will **not** be updating it.
- arch: My dotfiles that I use on my Arch Linux daily driver.

In the future, this repo may contain additional branches.

TODO:
- (branch) nixOs: Bad Nix configuration as I experiment with NixOS on an unused laptop.
